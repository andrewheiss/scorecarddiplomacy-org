The code for creating all the project's figures, tables, and analysis is available in a [version-controlled repository at GitHub](https://github.com/andrewheiss/scorecard-diplomacy). Everything in the book can be recreated using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), preferably within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), since the code is structured as an RStudio project.

This project uses data from dozens of different datasets and sources. All data can be accessed in the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewheiss/scorecard-diplomacy/tree/master/data). The [most recent release of the project's source code](https://github.com/andrewheiss/scorecard-diplomacy/releases) also contains this data.
