Many different sources were used for content analysis, including the annual [Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report from the US State Department](https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/), US State Department diplomatic cables, and as documents from various intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that deal with trafficking in persons. 

Media stories and State Department cables were loaded into qualitative data analysis software. QDA Miner is required to view this analysis, and is accessible either for free with [QDA Miner Lite](https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/freeware/) (free) or with the [full version](https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/).

Both cables and media stories were coded for reactions of officials to the annual TIP Report. The codes are explained in Chapter 4 in the book and can also be found in the [Methods Appendix](/files/pdfs/Judith%20Kelley%2C%20Scorecard%20Diplomacy%2C%20Methods%20Appendix.pdf).
