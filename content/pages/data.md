## Additional analysis and methods appendix

That stuff goes here.


## Content analysis

Many different sources were used for content analysis, including the annual Trafficking in Persons Report from the US State Department ((Hyperlink)) as well as documents from various intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that deal with trafficking in persons. 
In addition, systematic analysis was conducted on two sources: media stories and US Department of State cables. These were used for content analysis and background study for all the case studies as well as the reactions discussed in Chapter 4. 

The State Department cables were loaded into a qualitative software analysis software called QDA Miner.  The software is required to view the files.   A Lite (free) version of QDA Miner can be found at: https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/freeware/; a full version of
QDA Miner can be found at: https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/ 

In addition, media stories were identified in Lexis Nexis using the parameters in the file details.txt (insert link). Both cables and media stories were coded for reactions of officials to the annual Trafficking in Persons Report. The codes are explained in Chapter 4 in the book and can also be found in the methods appendix on this site


### Cables

The codes and their explanation are viewable through the data file which can be found here: Scorecard Diplomacy.ppj.
