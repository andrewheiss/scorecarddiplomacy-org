In the summer of 2014 we fielded a survey to NGOs around the world. About 500 NGOs working in 133 countries responded to a survey designed to understand their engagement with the US and the TIP Report, as well as their assessments
of the role of the US in their countries and their own governmentsâ€™
performance.

The survey was based on a database over 1103 NGOs assembled between 2012 an 2014. received responses from 480 unique organizations, yielding a participation rate of 43.5 percent. Because NGOs often work in multiple countries, we allowed respondents to answer a series of country- specific questions for up to five different countries, resulting in 561 country- organization responses.
