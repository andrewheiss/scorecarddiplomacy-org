## Special thanks

Special thanks goes to my research assistant Andrew Heiss for his extensive assistance in all aspects of this book. Andrew was nothing short of a wizard. He administered the global NGO survey and helped me continue my research. He kept me sane. He also deserves credit for all the fine figures throughout this book.

In addition, I'd like to thank the many Duke University students who helped along the way. Thanks to Miguel Guevara Jr., Lena de Santo, Maria Romano, Jan Pachon, Erik Wu, Justine Hong, Nadia Hajji, Elizabeth Reiser, Renata Dinamarco, Ade Olayinka, Elizabeth White, and Megan Ye. 

Two students in particular stand out: Gloria Dabek and Jessica Van Meir worked on this project for their entire Duke undergraduate career. They both worked on the case studies and Jessica did interviews in several countries.
