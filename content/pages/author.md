Judith Kelley (PhD, Harvard) is the Kevin D. Gorter Professor of Public Policy and Professor of Political Science and the Senior Associate Dean at the Duke Sanford School of Public Policy. She is also a senior fellow with the Kenan Institute for Ethics. In 2009-2010 she was a visiting fellow at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. Her publications reflect her research interests in the role of international actors in promoting political and human rights reforms. In 2012 she was inducted into the Bass Society of Fellows at Duke, which recognizes faculty for excellence in both teaching and scholarship. The Smith Richardson Foundation has supported her as a Policy and Strategy Fellow. She also was the Chair of the Editorial Board of International Organization.

Kelley's work focuses on how states, international organizations and NGOs can promote domestic political reforms in problem states, and how international norms, laws and other governance tools influence state behavior. Her work addresses human rights and democracy, international election observation, and human trafficking. Past work has focused on the International Criminal Court, the European Union and other international organizations. Details on her election monitoring project are on the web at [Project on International Election Monitoring](https://sites.duke.edu/kelley/). The work behind “Scorecard Diplomacy: Grading States to Influence Their Reputation and Behavior,” was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation and another from the Smith Richardson Foundation. Her work has been published by Princeton University Press, and in journals such as the American Political Science Review, the American Journal of Political Science, International Organization, International Studies Quarterly, and the Journal of Common Market Studies. Her book, [*Monitoring Democracy: When International Election Observation Works and Why It Often Fails*](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9748.html) (Princeton 2012) was "One of Choice's Outstanding Academic Titles for 2013" and also received the Chadwick F. Alger Prize, which is awarded by the International Studies Association to recognize the "best book published in the previous calendar year on the subject of international organization and multilateralism.”

### Special thanks

Special thanks goes to my research assistant [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com) for his extensive assistance in all aspects of this book. Andrew was nothing short of a wizard. He administered the global NGO survey and helped me continue my research. He kept me sane. He also deserves credit for all the fine figures throughout this book.

In addition, I'd like to thank the many Duke University students who helped along the way. Thanks to Miguel Guevara Jr., Lena de Santo, Maria Romano, Jan Pachon, Erik Wu, Justine Hong, Nadia Hajji, Elizabeth Reiser, Renata Dinamarco, Ade Olayinka, Elizabeth White, and Megan Ye. 

Two students in particular stand out: Gloria Dabek and Jessica Van Meir worked on this project for their entire Duke undergraduate career. They both worked on the case studies and Jessica did interviews in several countries.
