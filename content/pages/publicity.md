## Reviews

> Judith G. Kelley bridges rigorous academic research and policy relevance as
> realms too often divorced. She is uniquely creative in delivering unexpected
> conclusions and hard proof. This study offers subtle insights about what
> actually works in US human trafficking policy. The book sheds light on how
> reputation affects governments’ conduct and laws. It addresses important
> questions about the relative impact of rating countries, sanctions, diplomacy
> over time, consistency, and unilateralism in foreign policy. *Scorecard
> Diplomacy* is a major work on norms and impactful statecraft, important far
> beyond its fascinating case study on combating the sex and labor slavery of
> our time.
> 
> —Mark P. Lagon, Ph.D., Centennial Fellow, Walsh School of Foreign Service,
> Georgetown University, and former U.S. Ambassador-At-Large to Combat
> Trafficking Persons.

> *Scorecard Diplomacy* is social science at its best. Marshaling a wealth of
> material and methods, Judith G. Kelley explains why states care about
> reputations and how grading of their performances affects behavior.

> A quiet revolution has occurred in global governance over the last two
> decades. States, international organizations, and non-state actors are
> scoring, ranking, and measuring states for all kinds of reasons—which country
> is the least corrupt, the most democratic, and on and on. But do states
> actually care enough to change their behavior so that they can move up in the
> rankings? *Scorecard Diplomacy* is the first place to look when trying to
> answer these questions. Careful, systematic, and consistently compelling,
> Kelley makes the case that these scores can matter. In doing so she not only
> provides an important statement on the new global governance, she also
> contributes to the ongoing recognition of the different kinds of power that
> exist in world affairs. A fascinating and important contribution to
> international relations and global governance.

> —Michael Barnett, International Affairs and Political Science, George
> Washington University, Washington, DC

> *Scorecard Diplomacy* is a fascinating study of how the United States uses
> its assessment power to influence policy change around the world. Judith G.
> Kelley shows that ratings matter in the public sphere. This is an incredibly
> insightful look at how modern US diplomacy has harnessed anxiety about
> ‘grades’ to provoke change in national policies—and has kept human
> trafficking on the global agenda.
